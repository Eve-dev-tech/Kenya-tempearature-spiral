# Kenya-tempearature-spiral
This is a project that visualizes deviations from the average temperature between 1991 and 2016. Inspired by Ed Hawkins' climate spiral in 2017

Ed Hawkins, a climate scientist, tweeted the following animated visualization in 2017 and captivated the world:

This visualization shows the deviations from the average temperature between 1850 and 1900. It was reshared millions of times over Twitter and Facebook
and a version of it was even shown at the opening ceremony for the Rio Olympics. The visualization is compelling, because it helps viewers understand both the varying fluctuations in temperatures, and the sharp overall increases in average temperatures in the last 30 years. 


You can read more about the motivation behind this visualization on Ed Hawkins' website

I'll specifically be working with pandas (for representing and munging the data) and matplotlib (for visualizing the data). 

# Data 
The underlying data was released by World Bank. The dataset can be downloaded directly here https://africaopendata.org/dataset/kenya-climate-data-1991-2016
